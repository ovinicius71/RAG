This file contains detailed descriptions of the world's major biomes, including tundra, taiga, temperate forests, grasslands, deserts, tropical rainforests, and aquatic biomes. Each biome is described in terms of its climate, flora, fauna, and human impact. For example, the tundra biome is characterized by its cold climate, with average temperatures below freezing for most of the year. The ground is permanently frozen, known as permafrost, which limits plant growth to low-lying vegetation like mosses, lichens, and small shrubs. Animals adapted to this environment include caribou, arctic foxes, and polar bears. Human activity in the tundra is minimal but includes indigenous populations and, increasingly, resource extraction, which poses threats to the delicate ecosystem. Similar detailed descriptions are provided for each biome, making this file extensive
